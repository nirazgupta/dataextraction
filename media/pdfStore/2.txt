Introduction  
The purpose of this document is to present the Cityringen - Branch off to 
Sydhavnen project, and the scope of works for the contracts for this project.  
Section 1 provides an overview of the Cityringen project including branch off to 
Nordhavnen and branch off to Sydhavnen. 
Section 2 provides the Scope of Works for the Civil Works design and build 
contract CRSH1 and the Transportation System design and build contract CRSH4. 
Section 3 provides the structure and content of the main interfacing contracts. 
1.1 
The Project 
Cityringen - Branch off to Sydhavnen is an integrated part of Cityringen. Therefore 
the same principles and concepts used on Cityringen shall apply for the Branch off 
to Sydhavnen project. The system is to be operated as a single entity, and is to be 
constructed so that the works for the Branch off to Sydhavnen do not interrupt 
the operation of Cityringen unnecessary. The interfaces between Cityringen and 
the Branch off to Sydhavnen are incorporated in the contract packages for the 
Cityringen - Branch off to Sydhavnen.

CITYRINGEN BRANCH OFF TO SYDHAVNEN 
SHG-SW 
Cityringen consists of approximately 15 km double track in tunnel serving 17 deep 
and semi-shallow stations. Cityringen includes 3 shafts at Nørrebroparken, Sønder 
Boulevard and Øster Søgade. In order to support normal and fall back operation 
as well as maintenance activities the double track structure includes two diamond 
crossings in tunnel and one placed on the ramp at the entry to the Control and 
Maintenance Center (CMC).  
The branch off to Nordhavnen consists of 2.5km double track, two stations 
(Nordhavn and Orientkaj), a shaft at Krauseparken and a diamond crossing at the 
ramp between Nordhavn and Orientkaj.  
The branch off to Sydhavnen consists of 4.5 km double track, five stations 
(at/Fisketorvet (Fit), at/Enghave Brygge (Ebr), at/Sluseholmen (Slu), at/ Mozarts 
Plads (Mop) and Ny Ellebjerg (Nel)), two diamonds crossings one at H. C. 
Ørstedsværket (Øvk) just before at/Enghave Brygge station, and the other at 
Gåsebæk shaft (Gåb) before Ny Ellebjerg station. Refer to track schematic in SHG-
CB 3.4.A. 
The Cityringen railway infrastructure has been devised as a double track ring 
configuration, Figure 2. The passenger load is expected to be heaviest on the 
eastern part of the ring, i.e. between København H (Kh) – Kongens Nytorv (Kgn) – 
Østerport (Kk) and less heavy on the western part, i.e. Østerport (Kk) – 
Frederiksberg (Fb) – København H (Kh). 
Cityringen is therefore envisaged to be serviced with a two-way ring-line called 
M3 where trains are running the full ring as well as a pendulum line called M4 
serving only the eastern part from Ny Ellebjerg (Nel) through all Sydhavnen 
stations, to København H (Kh) through Kongens Nytorv (Kgn) and Østerport (Kk) to 
Nordhavnen and Orientkaj (Ork). The principle is shown in Figure 2 below:

CITYRINGEN BRANCH OFF TO SYDHAVNEN 
SHG-SW 
Cityringen M3 and M4 passenger service will be 24 hours, 7 days a week. 
Expected headways (train intervals) on weekdays are as follows: 
  Circular line M3: 
20 trains per hour leading to a 180 sec headway 
  Pendulum line M4: (Ny Ellebjerg to Orientkaj station)  
20 trains per hour leading to a 180 sec headway. 
Train headway (train interval) is defined as the time distance between two 
consecutive trains passing the same point. The basic requirement for Cityringen 
including branch off to Nordhavnen and Sydhavnen is that an operational 
headway of minimum 90 sec shall be possible. Furthermore the system shall be 
designed to allow down to 60 sec headway during fall back situations. 
The overall target of service quality for Cityringen is defined as the service 
availability (SA) which expresses the ability of the transportation system (trains, 
infrastructure and operation & maintenance organisation) to meet the headway 
requirements. The SA target for Cityringen is 98% which means that monitored 
over an agreed period 98% of all trains must meet the headway requirements. 
Passenger service will be fully automatic and driverless. The absence of a driver to 
run the trains does not mean that there is no staff to serve passengers. Stewards 
will be on board some (not all) trains and in stations according to a rotation 
scheme to assist passengers, take care of incidents and check tickets. 
Passenger service will run under headway regulation which means that the 
automatic train control system (ATC) commands and adjust train departure in 
such a manner that the headway requirements are being fulfilled during the time 
periods of the day, cf. table example above. 
Cityringen shall have transfer facilities to the existing metro stations at Kongens 
Nytorv and Frederiksberg. Further, transfer facilities will be provided connecting 
to the existing regional- and S-train railway stations at København H station, at 
Østerport station, at Nørrebro station, at Nordhavn station and at Ny Ellebjerg 
station. 
Stations and vehicles will be equipped with state of the art passenger safety and 
information systems including dynamic passenger information displays, call-points 
and high quality live video surveillance systems.

Figure 3 
Cross-section of a typical deep station  
The passenger vehicles consist of 3-car articulated trains of approximately 39 m in 
length, a width of 2.65 m and a floor height of 0.81 m. The trains will run on steel 
wheels on steel rails. The trains shall be comfortable with floors at platform level. 
Materials shall meet high qualitative and aesthetic requirements with high fire 
resistance and be suitable for the expected use.

The Control and Maintenance Centre (CMC) will provide facilities for operation 
and maintenance, storage, administration and facilities for the staff for Cityringen 
including the branch off to Nordhavnen and Sydhavnen. Modern main control 
centre and emergency control centre shall provide a good working environment 
and facilities for train operation, surveillance and passenger service during normal 
and fall-back operation.

SHG-SW 
  M&E works to the stations, shafts and tunnels 
  Architectural works to the stations and shafts.  
  Art works to the underground stations 
 
The CRSH1 Contractor shall design, coordinate all design and construction 
interfaces with works by others, and construct all works within the contract 
scope.  
The CRSH1 contract has major design and construction interfaces to the following 
separate contracts: 
  CRSH4 Transportation System contract (TS) 
  TSC Cityringen Transportation Systems Contract 
 
In the following subsections the scope of work is described and illustrated.  
2.2.1  Bored tunnel 
The works cover the tunnels from Havneholmen shaft to Ny Ellebjerg station and 
includes approximately 4,000 m of twin bored tunnels with pre-cast segmental 
lining plus two cross passages with pump sumps established at tunnel low points 
by the use of sprayed concrete lining (SCL) between the bored tunnels.  
The tunnel work site will be at Enghave Brygge and it is envisaged that TBMs will 
have to be launched from Ørstedværket shaft first towards Havneholmen shaft 
from which location the TBMs will be transported back to Ørstedværket shaft 
where they will be launched again towards Ny Ellebjerg station. All material 
supplies and tunnel muck shall be handled at Ørstedværket shaft.  
The tunnel construction will be through the Copenhagen Limestone (mainly Upper 
Copenhagen Limestone), or the Bryozene Limestone. Between Enghave Brygge 
station and Sluseholmen station the TBMs will have to cross the Carlsberg Fault 
which also represents the shift in geology from Copenhagen Limestone, north and 
east of the fault, to Bryozene Limestone, south and west of the fault. The 
quaternary layers of till and meltwater deposits above the limestone typically 
have a thickness of 5 to 10 m and the groundwater table is typically located 2 to 5 
m below the ground surface. The tunnel depth varies from approximately 12 m to 
30 m below ground surface.

Between Fisketorvet and Sluseholmen stations the tunnels will pass below a new 
town development area with buildings of up to generally 9 stories height which 
typically are founded on piles extending down to the top of the limestone or a few 
meters into the limestone. Some buildings will exceed 9 stories in height. After 
Sluseholmen station the tunnel passes below Sydhavnsgade railway tunnel owned
