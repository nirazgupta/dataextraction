The purpose of this document is to present the Cityringen - Branch off to Sydhavnen project, and the scope of works for the contracts for this project.
Section 1 provides an overview of the Cityringen project including branch off to Nordhavnen and branch off to Sydhavnen. Section 2 provides the Scope of Works for the Civil Works design and build contract CRSH1 and the Transportation System design and build contract CRSH4. Section 3 provides the structure and content of the main interfacing contracts. 1.1 The Project Cityringen - Branch off to Sydhavnen is an integrated part of Cityringen. Therefore the same principles and concepts used on Cityringen shall apply for the Branch off to Sydhavnen project. The system is to be operated as a single entity, and is to be constructed so that the works for the Branch off to Sydhavnen do not interrupt the operation of Cityringen unnecessary. The interfaces between Cityringen and the Branch off to Sydhavnen are incorporated in the contract packages for the Cityringen - Branch off to Sydhavnen.

Page: 6 of 33 Cityringen consists of approximately 15 km double track in tunnel serving 17 deep and semi-shallow stations. Cityringen includes 3 shafts at Nørrebroparken, Sønder Boulevard and Øster Søgade. In order to support normal and fall back operation as well as maintenance activities the double track structure includes two diamond crossings in tunnel and one placed on the ramp at the entry to the Control and Maintenance Center (CMC).
The branch off to Nordhavnen consists of 2.5km double track, two stations (Nordhavn and Orientkaj), a shaft at Krauseparken and a diamond crossing at the ramp between Nordhavn and Orientkaj.
The branch off to Sydhavnen consists of 4.5 km double track, five stations (at/Fisketorvet (Fit), at/Enghave Brygge (Ebr), at/Sluseholmen (Slu), at/ Mozarts Plads (Mop) and Ny Ellebjerg (Nel)), two diamonds crossings one at H. C. Ørstedsværket (Øvk) just before at/Enghave Brygge station, and the other at Gåsebæk shaft (Gåb) before Ny Ellebjerg station. Refer to track schematic in SHG-CB 3.4.A. The Cityringen railway infrastructure has been devised as a double track ring configuration, Figure 2. The passenger load is expected to be heaviest on the eastern part of the ring, i.e. between København H (Kh)
Kongens Nytorv (Kgn)
Østerport (Kk) and less heavy on the western part, i.e. Østerport (Kk)
Frederiksberg (Fb)
København H (Kh). Cityringen is therefore envisaged to be serviced with a two-way ring-line called M3 where trains are running the full ring as well as a pendulum line called M4 serving only the eastern part from Ny Ellebjerg (Nel) through all Sydhavnen stations, to København H (Kh) through Kongens Nytorv (Kgn) and Østerport (Kk) to Nordhavnen and Orientkaj (Ork). The principle is shown in Figure 2 below:

Page: 7 of 33 Cityringen M3 and M4 passenger service will be 24 hours, 7 days a week. Expected headways (train intervals) on weekdays are as follows:
Circular line M3: 20 trains per hour leading to a 180 sec headway
Pendulum line M4: (Ny Ellebjerg to Orientkaj station)
20 trains per hour leading to a 180 sec headway. Train headway (train interval) is defined as the time distance between two consecutive trains passing the same point. The basic requirement for Cityringen including branch off to Nordhavnen and Sydhavnen is that an operational headway of minimum 90 sec shall be possible. Furthermore the system shall be designed to allow down to 60 sec headway during fall back situations. The overall target of service quality for Cityringen is defined as the service availability (SA) which expresses the ability of the transportation system (trains, infrastructure and operation & maintenance organisation) to meet the headway requirements. The SA target for Cityringen is 98% which means that monitored over an agreed period 98% of all trains must meet the headway requirements. Passenger service will be fully automatic and driverless. The absence of a driver to run the trains does not mean that there is no staff to serve passengers. Stewards will be on board some (not all) trains and in stations according to a rotation scheme to assist passengers, take care of incidents and check tickets. Passenger service will run under headway regulation which means that the automatic train control system (ATC) commands and adjust train departure in such a manner that the headway requirements are being fulfilled during the time periods of the day, cf. table example above. Cityringen shall have transfer facilities to the existing metro stations at Kongens Nytorv and Frederiksberg. Further, transfer facilities will be provided connecting to the existing regional- and S-train railway stations at København H station, at Østerport station, at Nørrebro station, at Nordhavn station and at Ny Ellebjerg station. Stations and vehicles will be equipped with state of the art passenger safety and information systems including dynamic passenger information displays, call-points and high quality live video surveillance systems.

TSC Cityringen Transportation Systems Contract
In the following subsections the scope of work is described and illustrated.
2.2.1 Bored tunnel The works cover the tunnels from Havneholmen shaft to Ny Ellebjerg station and includes approximately 4,000 m of twin bored tunnels with pre-cast segmental lining plus two cross passages with pump sumps established at tunnel low points by the use of sprayed concrete lining (SCL) between the bored tunnels.
The tunnel work site will be at Enghave Brygge and it is envisaged that TBMs will have to be launched from Ørstedværket shaft first towards Havneholmen shaft from which location the TBMs will be transported back to Ørstedværket shaft where they will be launched again towards Ny Ellebjerg station. All material supplies and tunnel muck shall be handled at Ørstedværket shaft.
The tunnel construction will be through the Copenhagen Limestone (mainly Upper Copenhagen Limestone), or the Bryozene Limestone. Between Enghave Brygge station and Sluseholmen station the TBMs will have to cross the Carlsberg Fault which also represents the shift in geology from Copenhagen Limestone, north and east of the fault, to Bryozene Limestone, south and west of the fault. The quaternary layers of till and meltwater deposits above the limestone typically have a thickness of 5 to 10 m and the groundwater table is typically located 2 to 5 m below the ground surface. The tunnel depth varies from approximately 12 m to 30 m below ground surface.
